# ft_linear_regression
## Description
This project will be your first steps into AI and Machine Learning. You're going to start with a simple, basic machine learning algorithm. You will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

### Not said in the fucking subject
* This is about you own machine learning so :
    * insert a loop to create your thetas with tmp_thetas formulas
* learningRate is a number you can adjust yourself, start with 1
* I use flake8 to have some norm to code
* I've set an environment to work, so use it to see my work please
* thetas -= tmpthetas
